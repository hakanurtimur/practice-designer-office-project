**Designer App** allows efficient management of design requests. Clients can create design requests, which are then seamlessly forwarded to account managers and assigned to designers. When designers complete their projects, account managers have the option to approve or reject them. Approved projects are presented to clients for their consideration, where clients can accept or reject the final designs.

**Designer App** enables efficient management of design requests with the following workflow:

1. **Client Request**: A client submits a design request along with a title and description.

2. **Request Assignment**: The request is automatically assigned to an account manager who creates the necessary brief and prepares it for the designer.

3. **Designer Assignment**: The account manager forwards the request to the designer, who accepts it, uploads the required files, and adds notes.

6. **Approval and Delivery**: Once the designer completes the project, the account manager reviews and approves it. The approved design is then delivered to the client.
